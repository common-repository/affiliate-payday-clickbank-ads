== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin allow different sized banners =
No, at this time the plugin only shows banners that are 300px in width. We plan to expand on this in future versions.

Banners could be scaled to smaller sizes using css, but the results will vary.
 
= Does the plugin work in the footer and header areas =
Possibly. The plguin was specifically designed with the sidebar area in mind. Banners are auto wrapped to new lines using this size. If you have a footer area thatr will show more than 1200px wide the banners should still work, but this was not the intent so there is no garantee this will work in footer areas or header areas. Give it a go with your theme and see how it works. :) 
 
= Can I rotate only my own products instead of rotating for other members? =
Not at present time. In the future we may allow rotating your ads based on whether you are a free or an upgraded member at affiliate payday however we have no time frame estimations for this.

= Will this work on versions of wordpress less than 5.3.2? =
We have only tested this plugin on version 5.3.2 and will test on future versions of wordpress. If you install it on an earier version and find it works, please reach out and let us know so we can inform others.
